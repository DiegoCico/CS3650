# Assignment 4: Data Structures in C

This is your starter code repo for Assignment 4. The assignment has two parts: [queue](queue/) and [vector](vector/).
Please see the corresponding description on our website under [Assignments](https://khoury-cs3650.github.io/hw.html).

## Makefile

Use the provided Makefiles ([queue/Makefile](queue/Makefile) and [vector/Makefile](vector/Makefile)) to make (re-)compilation easier:

 - `make` will compile the queue/vector implementation and the unit tests
 - `make test` will compile and run the provided unit tests
 - `make valgrind` will run a memory leak test
 - `make clean` will remove the executable and object files

## More Notes on Vectors

You can find additional implementation notes on vectors in [vector.md](vector.md).
